# ⚡ About FinPro

FinPro originated as my own passion project in 2020. At that point, I'd already tried a bunch of other FPM's, but all of them lacked in at least one of the following points:

- They were not user-friendly
- Their features lacked a full-fledged budgeting tool
- I was never in control of my own data

FinPro is my attempt to solve all of these issues. It has helped me manage my finances for a while now and I hope it can be useful for you as well.

## ✨ Features

Here are the main features of FinPro:

- **Localization (Multilingual support)** - Native full support to both English and Portuguese
- **Transactions** - You can add transactions manually or import them in batches from the clipboard (from a .csv file or directly from your bank's homebanking solution)
- **Split Transactions** - Easily split an already added transaction into two different ones, all with a few clicks
- **Accounts** - You can track all of your accounts, including their transactions and balances
- **Categories & Entities** - You can create as many of these as you want to better segment your income and spending
- **Rules & Auto-categorization** - With rules, you can make your transactions importing smarter and faster, by allowing FinPro to automatically categorize some of your imported transactions, based on your specifications
- **Budgets** - Taking a Boonzi-style approach to budgeting, our budget tool allows you to budget for your future, month by month
- **Stats** - this one's for the data nerds. Here you have an overview of your patrimony's evolution across each month and get a forecast of your financial future for the years to come
- **Account Management** - Change your password, etc.
- **Investing** - Keeping track of your investments (currently in beta!)
- **Theming** - Multiple (white & dark) themes to choose from!

## 🛣️ Roadmap

Here's some of the features currently in development or planned for the near future:

- **Goals** - Record and keep track of your goals to keep yourself motivated at all times
- **Better Account Management** - Allowing the user to change its data (email, profile photo...)
- **Better Stats** - Add more complex & interesting stats
- & much more...
